Study dagger and DI

### All concepts you need to know
#### @Component
`@Component` tells Dagger to implement an interface or abstract class that creates and returns one or more application objects.
Dagger will generate a class that implements the component type. The generated type will be named DaggerYourType (or DaggerYourType_NestedType for nested types)

#### @Inject
`@Inject` on a constructor tells Dagger how to instantiate that class. Weâ€™ll see more shortly.
